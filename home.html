                    Despite the immense dangers and obstacles, the UN continues to deliver desperately needed
                    humanitarian aid in Gaza. Here is an overview of the humanitarian efforts in the occupied territory.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In conflict zones across the world, UN humanitarian workers work under extreme conditions, 
                    but it is hard to exaggerate the risks they are facing in Gaza, where hospitals, schools, and refugee
                    camps are not immune to the threats of bombardment.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Evacuation orders continue to be issued, pushing more people south in fear for their safety. 
                    Many roads are becoming impassable as more informal sites continue to spring up. In addition, the cold 
                    winter season, with strong winds and torrential rains, is adding another layer of challenges to 
                    UN convoys carrying supplies to the people in need.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The UN is leading aid efforts in Gaza, working closely with all humanitarian partners, including 
                    international and national NGOs.

                    The UN aid coordination office (OCHA) is tasked with ensuring that the flurry of response efforts 
                    is as efficient as possible, avoiding duplication, and accurately prioritizing aid delivery according 
                    to needs. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    The situation is catastrophic: food and water are in short supply and nearly non-existent 
                    in northern Gaza, and the few remaining health centres in the Strip are overwhelmed with patients.
                    Aid is available, but convoys face excessive delays at Israeli checkpoints, agreed routes that are 
                    impossible to navigate because of the bombings, and repeated access denials by Israeli authorities. 
                    As a result, only a fraction of planned aid deliveries is getting through.

                    UNRWA, one of the oldest and largest of the UN agencies, was set up seven decades ago, to provide 
                    relief for Palestine refugees. In Gaza, UNRWA operates schools, runs relief and social programmes, 
                    and healthcare services.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The crisis has severely affected all of UNRWA’s operations in the Strip: as of 10 January, 
                    some 1.7 million people were sheltering in, or nearby, 155 UNRWA facilities, which are 
                    “far exceeding their intended capacity” and have been targeted by bombardments: the agency 
                    says that their installations have received more than 60 direct hits, with at least 319 
                    displaced people killed in the agency’s shelters and more than 1,135 injured since 7 October. 
                    In addition, more than 140 UNRWA colleagues are known to have been killed to date.

                <p>
                    In all, 23 UN agencies, funds, and programmes are present in Palestine, under the leadership 
                    of the Resident Coordinator, The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Palestine comprises all 
                    heads of UN agencies operating in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt).
                    <br/><br/>
                    As well the entities mentioned above, many major agencies are represented in the oPt, including 
                    the International Labour Organization (ILO), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Women, the UN 
                    Development Programme (UNDP), and UNESCO.

                    ROME, Jan 12 (IPS) - “We are the mothers, daughters and sisters of the 
                    missing and murdered Baloch. We are thousands.” Mahrang Baloch, a 28-year-old 
                    doctor from Pakistan's Balochistan province, is blunt when introducing herself 
                    and the rest of a group protesting in central Islamabad.

                <p>
                    JOHANNESBURG, Jan 12 (IPS) - Israel disputed both South Africa’s 
                    jurisdiction and the provisional measures that it demanded the International 
                    Court of Justice impose on the State of Israel to prevent genocide.

                <p>
                    LONDON, Jan 12 (IPS) - Bangladesh just held an election. But it was far from an exercise in democracy.
                    Sheikh Hasina won her fourth consecutive term, and fifth overall, as prime minister in the general election 
                    held on 7 January. The result was never in doubt, with the main opposition party, the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), 
                    boycotting the vote over the ruling Awami League’s refusal to let a caretaker government oversee the election. 
                    This practice, abolished by the Awami League government in 2011, was, the BNP asserted, the only way to ensure a 
                    free and fair vote.

                <p>
                    WASHINGTON DC, Jan 12 (IPS) - The world faces the existential threat of a climate change crisis, and it is 
                    becoming increasingly clear that the outcome of the latest UN climate summit, COP28 — hosted as it was by the CEO 
                    of one of the world’s largest oil companies, and filled with a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists — is not going 
                    to do much to change that.

                <p>
                    UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged countries to avoid an escalation in the situation in the Red Sea, 
                    where Houthi rebels in Yemen have been attacking commercial vessels amid the ongoing war in Gaza.

                <p>
                    The UN Security Council met on Friday for briefings on the worsening situation across the Middle East, looking first 
                    at threats of forced displacement from Gaza and then the escalating conflict in and around the Red Sea – all as the war in 
                    Gaza approaches the 100-day mark. The UN relief chief told ambassadors that any Gazans forced to flee the enclave must be 
                    allowed to return "as international law demands", while a senior political affairs official warned that the cycle of violence 
                    over Red Sea shipping lanes risked major repercussions in Yemen and the wider region.
